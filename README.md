# CPSC 542 Software Testing group Project

# Apollo tutorial 

This is the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `start`: Starting point for the tutorial
- `final`: Final version

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
## Selenium testing
Used this https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-setup-selenium-on-node-environment-ee33023da72d as a guide. 

Everyone will need to add the chrome driver to their computer and add it as a path variable. Details on doing this are 
found in the above medium link.
